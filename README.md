# Hotels WebApp - Backend

A backend that aims to deliver a rapid, responsive, and reliable user-experience.

This application leverages the 'actix_web' framework to create a HTTP server that via 'sqlx' connects to a MySQL database.
The server allows clients to perform CRUD operations on the database and manages user authorization with 'jsonwebtoken'.
